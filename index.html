						<h1>Kangwa Ng'omalala's<br />
						Analytics Portfolio</h1>
						<p>I am an Aeronautical Engineering Graduate and aspiring Data Scientist, currently pursuing a master's degree in Analytics from Georgia Institute of Technology. I currently work as an Operations and Data Analyst at Meta. As you'll find in this portfolio, my interests lie in utilizing analytics to solve complex problems throughout the entire value chain in industries such as E-commerce, Fin-Tech, Supply Chain, Transportation, and Logistics. I am particularly interested in developing my skills in optimization and probabilistic modeling, as well as advancing my knowledge in machine learning techniques such as time series modeling, change detection, regression, and classification algorithms. My ultimate goal is to use these skills to develop innovative solutions that drive efficiency, improve decision-making, and enhance performance in these industries. I am committed to continuous learning and growth and I look forward to exploring new avenues to make a tangible and meaningful impact. <a href="hhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kangwa-j-f-ng-omalala/">@Kangwa_Ngomalala</a>

									<h2><a href="#">Peer to Peer Lending Optimizer<br />
									-  transforming lending through data-driven insights</a></h2>
									<p> In this project, I will be developing a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to optimize lending for investors. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and portfolio optimization techniques, the platform will provide investors with a suite of data-driven tools to assess borrower creditworthiness, loan appetite, and repayment likelihood. The platform will also construct a portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk based on specified factors such as investor risk profile, investment amount, and investment period. The goal of this project is to empower investors to achieve their financial goals and contribute to the growth of a more inclusive and democratized lending industry. It recognizes that while many peer-to-peer lending platforms have made it possible to quickly review loan applications, little has been done to help investors maximize their returns as they have to sift through long lists of borrowers.

										<h2><a href="#"> SmartShut  <br />
									- An Analytics-Based Solution for Optimizing Power Shut-offs </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/powerimage.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In this project, I aim to develop a solution for a power company to address two major issues they face - turning off power for customers who are never going to pay and logistical problems with manually shutting off high-risk customers. I plan to approach this problem in five main steps, which involve using data and models to determine if customer payment patterns have changed over time, predict the customers' likelihood of not paying their bills, estimate the cost of not shutting off the power, simulate the number of workers needed to shut off customers, and optimize for the shortest or highest cost-saving routes for shutting off power. The solution will help the power company make the most effective use of their limited capacity and limit revenue loss from not shutting off high-risk customers.</p>

									<p>In this project, I aim to help an ecommerce retailer optimize their delivery routes and improve their demand forecasting accuracy. The retailer faces two main challenges: delivering products efficiently to customers while minimizing delivery costs, and accurately predicting customer demand to ensure that they have sufficient inventory and minimize stockouts.</p>
