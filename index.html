							<h2>About My Portfolio Projects</h2>
							<p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that 
								reflect my expertise in analytics, data science and machine learning. 
								Each project is not only housed here for your exploration but also has its code repository on GitHub 
								, a Medium article link or a presentation on Youtube or a data vizualization app such as Tableau or D3, allowing for a deeper dive into the implementation details. 
								Throughout these projects, I've utilized a range of skills including Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, 
								SQL, Tableau and different Machine Learning models.</p>

								<h3>Multilingual Langauge Vocabulary Builder(NLP)</h3>
								<p>My team at Georgia Tech worked on a multilingual vocabulary builder application that 
									leverages Wikipedia data to create topic-based word embeddings and uncover semantic and 
									collocation relationships between words. We employed tools like Python, spaCy, NLTK, and 
									scikit-learn, mBERT for multilingual embeddings, cosine similarity for semantic graphs, and 
									BigramAssocMeasures in NLTK for collocation extraction. By combining robust preprocessing, semantic analysis, 
									and collocation extraction, we developed a graph-based vocabulary learning tool for language learning and NLP 
									research applications. The project highlights the power of integrating advanced NLP techniques with 
									large-scale data to address multilingual challenges effectively.

								<h3>Markov Chains / PageRank for Airline Operations</h3>
								<p>This project is a deep dive into the practical application of Markov Chains and Google’s famous PageRank algorithm within the domain of airline operations. 
									By conceptualizing an airline’s network of destinations as a graph, with airports serving as nodes and direct-flight 
									connections as edges, the project aims to rank airports (nodes) in the network based on flight 
									frequency, passenger traffic patterns, and revenue generated between flight routes.
									To achieve this, I utilized Python, NumPy, and SciPy for implementing the Markov Chain process and PageRank algorithm. 
									An understanding of matrices and linear algebra for calculating transition probability matrices, solving for steady-state distributions, 
									and implementing the iterative power method to converge to the PageRank values.
									This approach unlocks hidden patterns in the airline network that are not captured by descriptive statistics.</p>

								<h3>Network Intrusion Classification Techniques</h3>
								<p>This project is a deep dive into machine learning concepts with a specific focus on 
									cybersecurity. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, I address classification problems in 
									network security by employing supervised learning techniques to model nine attack types and normal vectors. 
									I make use of algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality ,  
									Naive Bayes , K-Nearest Neighbour,  Logistic Regression  
									and Neural Network Classifiers to enhance my knowledge in cybersecurity and trust and safety.</p>

								<h3>K-Means Clustering - Hands-On Image Compression</h3>
								<p>This article  is a hands-on exploration of image compression using the K-Means algorithm, 
									coded from scratch. By applying K-Means to a Super Mario PNG image, the article demonstrates 
									the process of image preprocessing and clustering, illustrating how this algorithm can be used to 
									reduce the complexity of visual data while preserving essential features. 
									This approach not only deepens one's understanding of K-Means but also highlights practical applications of machine 
									learning techniques in handling image data.</p>

								<h3>Spotify Genre Clustering and Classification</h3>
								<p>In this project, I collaborated with two team members on predictive modeling of Spotify song genres, 
									utilizing various clustering and classification techniques. We evaluated models such as GMM, DBScan, KMeans, 
									Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, KNN, and Random Forests. The work involved data preprocessing,
							   dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA, UMAP), and a detailed performance analysis to gain insights into genre clustering and classification.
